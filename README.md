# workload-orchestration

The workload-orchestration repo serves to host demos recorded by the team surrounding functionality that is provided by the Kueue component.

## Demos

Our demos are hosted on [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) but we also provide the raw demo files if users prefer to play them locally. 

E.g.
```
asciinema play demos/demo-folder/demo.cast
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can install asciinema by visiting their [Getting Started](https://docs.asciinema.org/getting-started/#__tabbed_1_1) page.
